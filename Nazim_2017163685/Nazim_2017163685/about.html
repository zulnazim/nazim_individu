	<h1><font color="white">About<font color="#ffff80"> Tunku Abdul Rahman</font></h1>
	<p class="details">In his later years, Tunku lived in a house in Penang. When he was ill he was treated at the Kuala Lumpur General Hospital. He died on December 6, 1990 at the age of 87 at 10:25 pm due to severe illness. The body was taken to his residence in Bukit Tunku and the next day was buried at the Langgar Royal Tomb, Alor Setar. On that day, all Malaysians are deeply saddened to lose the respected figure and also known as "Father of Independence"</p>

		<h1>Personal Life</h1>
		<p>That's in Kulim that Tunku married his first wife, Meriam Chong, the daughter of a Thai Chinese friend of his, Chong Ah Yong. Tunku's daughter, Tunku Khadijah, was born a year after their marriage. A year later, a son was born, Tunku Ahmad Nerang. Meriam Chong suffered a serious malaria attack a month after she gave birth to her second child and died.</p>

		<h1>Road to Independence</h1>
		<p>In 1954, Tunku led a group of delegates to London to gain Malayan independence. However, the inaugural attempt was unsuccessful. The following year, the first federal elections were held. The Alliance Party, which at the time was a coalition of UMNO and MCA, won 51 of the 52 seats contested. Tunku was appointed the first Chief Minister of Malaya. The MIC, which represented the Indians, later joined the Alliance Party in 1955. In 1955, Tunku made another trip to London to negotiate Malayan independence. This time, he succeeded, and August 31, 1957 was decided as the date of independence. As the British flag was lowered in Kuala Lumpur on Independence Day, Tunku led the crowd to shout "Merdeka!". The pictures of Tunku with his hands raised, and the recordings of his voice full of emotion but determined to lead the cheers, are now a common symbol of Malaysia's independence.</p>
